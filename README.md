Go version of Laravel

This repository is all about taking some of the most useful features found in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/),
and implement similar functionality in [GoLang](https://go.dev/). Since Go is compiled and type safe,web applications written in this language
are typically much, much faster, and far less error-prone that a similar application written in Laravel/PHP.
